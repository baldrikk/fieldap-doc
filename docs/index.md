#Asset selector

To populate your field layout you need to choose your structures from the Asset library.

Open the asset library by clicking the "Asset picker" icon shown above, which is located in the top left part of the Stage Area as shown below:
![Alt text](image/asset_lib_button.jpg)

This will reveal the asset library selector catalog as shown below. You can view the assets by category namely; Structures and Vessels. The number of assets in each category is shown behind the category name.
![Alt text](image/asset_list.jpg)

Select if you want an asset from either the Structure or Vessel category by clicking on the desired category. This will automatically expand the image list to display all assets in that category.

To add an asset to your field layout design in the Stage Area, simply click it and hold down the left mouse button while you drag it out of the asset list selector and onto the stage area on the right and release the mouse button.

###Connect Assets
FieldAP comes with a set of the most normal generic assets that can be used for a simple field layout. Most of these assets can be connected to each other as would be expected for a field layout. At present all assets have a fixed number and fixed location of connection points. 
The number of asset connection points depends on the asset you have selected. They are typically located just off the asset outline itself as show in the illustration below:
![Alt text](image/manifold.jpg)

To make a connection between two (2) assets or structures if you will you need to click once on the starting connection point once the mouse cursor changes to a cross selector. Then move the mouse over to the asset connection point that you want to connect to and click once again when the cross selector cursor is shown. The assets will then be connected together
