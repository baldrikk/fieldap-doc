###Connect Assets
FieldAP comes with a set of the most normal generic assets that can be used for a simple field layout. Most of these assets can be connected to each other as would be expected for a field layout. At present all assets have a fixed number and fixed location of connection points. 
The number of asset connection points depends on the asset you have selected. They are typically located just off the asset outline itself as show in the illustration below:
![Alt text](image/manifold.jpg)

To make a connection between two (2) assets or structures if you will you need to click once on the starting connection point once the mouse cursor changes to a cross selector. Then move the mouse over to the asset connection point that you want to connect to and click once again when the cross selector cursor is shown. The assets will then be connected together.

Note that you can have as many connections between structures that you want.

You will see a small "+" symbol next to the mouse pointer that indicates that by a left mouse click a curve edit point will be added.
