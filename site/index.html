<h3 id="asset-library">Asset Library</h3>
<p>The first step when creating a new project in FieldApp is typically to design a new field layout where you will plan the relevant field activities that will take place. To do this you can quickly and easily design the wanted field layout by using the "FieldApp Layout Designer" tools. Assets will typically be design elements that depict subsea installation structures or other operation equipment such as "Manifold", "Template", "FPSO" etc. 
<img alt="Screenshot" src="/image/asset_library.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="asset-selector">Asset selector</h1>
<p>To populate your field layout you need to choose your structures from the Asset library.</p>
<p>Open the asset library by clicking the "Asset picker" icon shown above, which is located in the top left part of the Stage Area as shown below:
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/asset_lib_button.jpg" /></p>
<p>This will reveal the asset library selector catalog as shown below. You can view the assets by category namely; Structures and Vessels. The number of assets in each category is shown behind the category name.
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/asset_list.jpg" /></p>
<p>Select if you want an asset from either the Structure or Vessel category by clicking on the desired category. This will automatically expand the image list to display all assets in that category.
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/vessels.jpg" /></p>
<p>To add an asset to your field layout design in the Stage Area, simply click it and hold down the left mouse button while you drag it out of the asset list selector and onto the stage area on the right and release the mouse button.</p>
<h2 id="rotate-delete-asset">Rotate / Delete Asset</h2>
<p>You can easily reposition and rotate your assets by clicking on them to. You will notice a dotted ring around the asset with 2 symbols (Rotate button and delete button).
To reposition the asset just click again on the active asset and hold the left mousebutton down while you reposition it and let let go. To Rotate it just activate the dottet ring by clicking on the asset and press the rotate button and hold the left mousebutton down while you rotate the asset to your wanted angle.
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/rotate.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="connect-assets">Connect Assets</h3>
<p>FieldAP comes with a set of the most normal generic assets that can be used for a simple field layout. Most of these assets can be connected to each other as would be expected for a field layout. At present all assets have a fixed number and fixed location of connection points. 
The number of asset connection points depends on the asset you have selected. They are typically located just off the asset outline itself as show in the illustration below:
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/manifold.jpg" /></p>
<p>To make a connection between two (2) assets or structures if you will you need to click once on the starting connection point once the mouse cursor changes to a cross selector. Then move the mouse over to the asset connection point that you want to connect to and click once again when the cross selector cursor is shown. The assets will then be connected together.
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/connection.jpg" />
Note that you can have as many connections between structures that you want.
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/multiple_connections.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="edit-connections">Edit Connections</h3>
<p>If you click on the connection line itself between two assets, you can add curvature edit points, which allows you to modify the layout of the connection line or connector if you will. You will see a small "+" symbol next to the mouse pointer that indicates that by a left mouse click a curve edit point will be added.
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/curves.jpg" />
To remove an edit point from the connector press and hold the "Shift" key and select the edit point on the connector. To remove an entire connection, press the "Backspace" key.</p>
<h3 id="connection-color">Connection Color</h3>
<p>You can also choose the color and thickness on your connections by choosing them in the menu below the stage grid.
(image when the design is ready)</p>
<h3 id="stage-area">Stage Area</h3>
<p>The stage area is your drawing canvas where you do your field layout design work as shown in the illustration below:
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/stage_area.jpg" />
You can zoom in and out on the stage area by pressing the zoom buttons in the top right of the stage area window.
Additionally you can also utilize the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</p>
<p>You can pan the stage area by clicking on the stage area background and holding down the left mouse button and move the mouse in the desired direction</p>
<h3 id="activities">Activities</h3>
<p>The activities window area will show all activities entered for the project as shown below. 
<img alt="Alt text" src="/image/activities.jpg" /></p>
<p>To add a new activity just press the "+" button. This will allow you to define a new activity that will take place including the activity duration and a descriptive name. </p>

<p>You can choose the resolution of the timeline by alternating between the "Hour", "Day" and "Week" buttons.

<p>To maximize the GANTT module press the "Timeline" button at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>To view both windows, press the "Split" button</p>

<p><img alt="Alt text" src="/image/top_bar.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="view-selector">View Selector</h3>
<p><img alt="Alt text" src="/image/view_selector.jpg" />
On the top navigation bar you can find the "View" control that will toggle between the three (3) different application views available to you. The FieldApp "/Split" view displays both the "Stage" area and the "Timeline(Gantt)" area at the same time. Selecting the "Stage" view hides the "Timeline" module from view so that the entire application view is used for "Stage" design. Lastly, selecting "Timeline" view will hide the "Stage" area so that the entire application screen is used for the"Timeline"s view.</p>
<h3 id="help">Help</h3>
